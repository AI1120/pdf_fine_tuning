              "'Consolidated Accounting List: \\n1. Performance and resources are assessed at a lower level. \\n2. The information presented to the board of directors is also an important consideration when evaluating the operating segments of a reporting entity. \\n3. The board of directors is typically the ultimate decision maker for the reporting entity and is responsible for overseeing the reporting entity’s operations. \\n4. The board of directors is usually presented with financial information at a more aggregated level than the subsidiary level at which the certifications are issued. \\n5. If the board of directors is presented with financial information at a more aggregated level than the subsidiary level, and the CODM uses this information to assess performance and allocate resources, these more aggregated components may be considered the reporting entity’s operating segments. \\n6. A start-up store location in a sixth city may have lower sales and gross margins than the mature store locations due to the start-up costs associated with the new store. \\n7. The CODM uses both operating income and pretax income to assess performance and allocate resources. \\n8. Segment operating profit is determined based on the same measurement principles that are used in the determination of consolidated operating profit. \\n9. Segment pretax income includes certain internal cost-of-capital charges that are eliminated in consolidation. \\n10. Segment operating profit should be the measure reported externally because operating profit most closely aligns with the measure reported in the consolidated financial statements. \\n11. If segment pretax income was determined based on the same measurement principles as consolidated pretax income, then segment pretax income would be the measure reported externally because this is the measure that is most similar to consolidated pretax income, which is the measure ASC 280-10-50-30 requires to be reconciled to segment profit/loss. \\n12. Disclosures should be made for interest income and expense because that information is included in the pretax income measure provided to the CODM (consistent with ASC 280-10-55-12 through ASC 280-10-55-15). \\n13. The 10% tests are used to determine whether an operating segment should be reported as a reportable segment. \\n14. The 10% tests are applied to the amounts that most closely correspond to the amounts reflected in the reporting entity’s consolidated financial statements. \\n15. The 10% tests are not applied to the segment’s external revenues, as this measure is not used in the consolidated financial statements.'"

The asset group should include all long-lived assets that are held and used, and should be determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Goodwill should be included in the asset group if it is part of a reporting unit, and the carrying amounts of any assets and liabilities not covered by ASC 360-10 should be adjusted in accordance with other applicable GAAP before testing the asset group for recoverability. Goodwill should be tested for impairment only after the carrying amounts of the other assets of the reporting unit, including the long-lived assets covered by ASC 360-10, have been tested for impairment under other applicable accounting guidance. The amount of the impairment loss may be zero. The entity has the option of discontinuing service on that route or continuing service on the route and incurring the losses.'"
